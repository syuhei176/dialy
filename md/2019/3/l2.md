# Application specific scalings in L2

These are very rough idea, there might be some flaws.

## Introduction

Beyond Plasma.

## Examples

### L2 Atomic Swap with No Online Requirement

* The atomic swap in Plasma require exchanging "confirmation signature" after the transaction submitted. So users need to be online.
* If users have full node, we can skip confirmation signature process by following way
  * Alice and Bob swap their coins. Alice has coinA and Bob has coinB.
  * Bob is malicious party, coinB has invalid history. It means the real owner of coinB is not Bob.
  * In current Plasma, Alice loses without confirmation signature, Bob get coinA but Alice get nothing.
  * So we add new exit-game method. If we show invalid behavior by "invalid history challenge" or "double spending", Alice can remove the atomic swap transaction from block. The last valid transaction in coinB is before "atomic swap"
